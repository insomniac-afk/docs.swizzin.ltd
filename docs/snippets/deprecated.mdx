:::warning
This application has been deprecated and removed from swizzin.
:::

One or more of these reasons can apply to why this application was removed:
- We have conducted surveys among our userbase to determine which apps were being used, and less than 2% have expressed their interest in this application.
- The application is severely out of date or no longer maintained, which causes us a severe headache when it comes to supporting it. While not a primary factor, this is very often a very strong support to other reasons.

We're sorry if this causes you any inconvenience.
