Calibre content server is a WebUI for [Calibre](calibre.mdx)

## Initial Setup

Installing calibre is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install calibre
```

This command will configure and install calibre on your system. A calibre library will be created under `~/Calibre Library` for your master user


## Access

After installation, Calibre content server will be accessible on `<domain>/calibrecs`, or `<domain>:8089`.

**Please note**: The content server is running on port **`8089`**, make sure to change that from the default wherever you are trying to connect to it.
When Calibre content server is running behind nginx, that port will not be accessible from the outside. When that's the case, please make sure to use port `443` and with SSL enabled.


## Service Management

The service file is located in the following location:



```bash
/etc/systemd/system/calibrecs.service
```

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="calibrecs"/>

### Options
import InstallOptsWarning from '../snippets/installoptswarning.md';

<InstallOptsWarning />

- `CALIBRE_LIBRARY_USER`:
  - Default: The name of the master user
  - Adds the dedicated calibre-web user to the group of this user
  - Used to infer possible calibre library path if not specified (see below)
  - Calibre-web's admin password will be set to the value of this user's password

- `CALIBRE_LIBRARY_PATH`:
   - Default
      - If exists, then: `/home/$CALIBRE_LIBRARY_USER/Calibre Library`
      - Otherwise unset, which will skip the library setup and password change procedure
   - Used to set up the calibre-web basic setup

## User management
Calibre-cs is set up as a multi-user application, however that is _not_ achieved through calibre-content server's built in user authentication module. All `box` managed users will have access to this.

## Configuration

### Specifying library path
Please edit `/etc/systemd/system/calibrecs.service`, at the end of the line beginning with `ExecStart=` you should add the path.
