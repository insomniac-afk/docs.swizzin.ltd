Calibre is an e-book management tool which stores books in its database.

## Initial Setup

Installing calibre is easy. Simply issue the following command from SSH:

```bash main
sudo box install calibre
```

This command will configure and install calibre on your system. A calibre library will be created under `~/Calibre Library` for your master user

### Options
import InstallOptsWarning from '../snippets/installoptswarning.md';

<InstallOptsWarning />

- `CALIBRE_LIBRARY_USER`:
  - Default: The name of the master user
  - The user who will own the calibre library

- `CALIBRE_LIBRARY_PATH`:
   - Default: `/home/$CALIBRE_LIBRARY_USER/Calibre Library`
   - The path of the library to create.

## Using Calibre

Calibre itself is a GUI and a CLI toolset. On its own, it does not come with any web interface.

The binaries are available to all users on the command line. Please refer to the claibre guide on how to use them.

Please install either [Calibre content server](calibre-cs.mdx) or [Calibre Web](calibre-web.mdx) if you'd like to have a web interface for your library.
